# Javascript_Solved_Coding_Problems
Some of the solved coding practice problems are taken from CodeWars , HackerRank

Every now and then I like to slove some Javascript coding problems for fun. It is one of sources of dopamine releases in my average day. It is not only about sloving a difficult coding problem, it's about how you approach a certrain coding problem and how I would go about sloving the probelm in my own way despite the fact that the solution might not be the fastest in terms of performance or the best way of approaching it. I believe in order to reach the level of an ideal and high performance solution is by solving more coding problems.
